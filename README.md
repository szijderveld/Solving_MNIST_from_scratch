# Solving_MNIST_from_scratch
Solving the MNIST image recognition data set without the use of packages such as scikit-learn


This poject was conducted in order to understand how a neural network work from the roots up though building all the component in a NN, minimising the use of external packages. This allowed me to go through the maths of building a network and then its implementation in python.

The NN is then used to solve the basic XOr gate, as a simple test and then implemented to solve the MNIST data set (recognising digits from images of handwriten digits).
